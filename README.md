This repository is an example of how to run a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
app on Google App Engine Standard Environment. It uses the 
[Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as the 
example app to deploy.


# Tutorial
See our [Running Django in the App Engine Standard Environment](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine) tutorial for instructions for setting up and deploying this sample application.

# FrontEnd
[Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) is chosen as the front-end framework and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is used to host the front-end server. This [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/run-expressjs-on-google-app-engine) is used to host the Node.JS and Express.JS on Google Cloud engine. To deploy into Goggle App, type `gcloud app deploy` in Cloud Shell.
